### Hi there 👋
This is my github, :grin:

I'm a developer who needs to update this git, but these are my personal projects, several are unfinished, some are just tests, others are just course exercises.
_Passionate about programming, curious by nature. Programmer focused most of his career on PHP, using JavaScript, MySQL._


:computer: Currently programming in: 
- 🐘 php
- :keyboard: javascript
- :desktop_computer:	jquery
- 🔭 whatever else arouses my curiosity.


🌱 I’m currently learning php, sql, English....

😅 _My English is very beginner, so I translated everything I wanted to put here on Google Translate_
